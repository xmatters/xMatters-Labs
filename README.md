# Contributing

## Getting started - Build an integration
When thinking about deisgning an integration, remember that there are really three types of integrations with the xMatters platform:
* **Data Source** - Getting group, user, or device data in or out of xMatters.
  * *Example*: None yet. Contribute one!
* **Event Triggers** - Initate events. These events do not necessarily need to notify people.
  * *Example*: [Chef](#chef), ServiceNow [Inform with xMatters](#inform-with-xmatters)
  * *One way*: Start here: https://support.xmatters.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001230823
  * *Closed-loop*: Start here: https://support.xmatters.com/hc/en-us/articles/211526223
* **Enrichment** - Intended to be tacked on to an existing integration, these provide enrichment or enhancement functionality.
  * *Example*: [StatusPage](#statuspage)
  * *Getting started*: https://support.xmatters.com/hc/en-us/articles/214627943

**Other Links**
* [xMatters Help](http://help.xmatters.com/)
* [xMatters API doc](http://help.xmatters.com/xmAPI/)

## Getting started - Post the repo
Once you've completed the integration, it's time to post the artifacts to github.

1. Head over to the [template](https://github.com/xmatters/xm-labs-template) for detailed instructions on how to get started.
2. After all changes have been made, open an [issue](https://github.com/xmatters/xMatters-Labs/issues) and we'll add it to the list. We might fork the repo to keep it "in house".
